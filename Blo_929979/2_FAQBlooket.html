      How do I assign a question set as homework for students to do on their own?
    </div>

    <div class="text">

      First, choose a question set by finding one in the Discover tab or creating one in the Create tab
      and then view it in your Dashboard. Now, click Host on this question set and select Tower of Doom,
      Factory, Crazy Kingdom, Tower Defense, or Café mode (these modes currently have homework options). Then, click
      Assign HW and it
      will walk you through the process. Finally, it will give you a link that students can click to
      play the game on their own time. All they have to do is click the link, they don't need an account.

      How do I share a question set I've created with another teacher?
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      Navigate to your dashboard and locate the set you would like to share. Then, click/hover over the Gear/Cog icon
      to the right
      of the trash can. Once this happens, a few buttons should show up above it. One of them may say Link. If so,
      click the Link button and it'll copy the link for you to share. If the Link button does not appear, your set is
      Private and
      you must click the pencil icon to edit the set, then click Edit Info and change the privacy setting to Public.

      First, choose a question set by finding one in the Discover tab or creating one in the Create tab
      and then view it in your Dashboard. Now, click Host on this question set and select a game mode.
      From there, it will walk you through the process of creating a game. Once this is done, you'll
      get a Game ID that you can share with students so they can join the game!

    <div class="text">
      Just click on the Blook or banner/title that you want to change and it will open a pop up
      where you can choose a new option! You can unlock new Blooks, banners, and titles in the Market.

      Nope! Only the teacher needs an account. You'll be able to host a game and any student can use the Game ID to
      join without logging in. However, students who do create accounts will have the ability to unlock new Blooks
      and track their stats.

      How can I debug connection issues?

    <div class="text">
      Before trying anything else, run our debugger at:&nbsp;
      <a class="link" href="https://debug.blooket.com/">https://debug.blooket.com/</a>
      <br />
      This will make sure all images load and you are not blocking any essential services for the live games.

      The images/Blooks aren't showing up?
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      This tends to be an issue with school networks and school-issued devices. The way to get the images to show
      up is to simply get someone who can edit the school network to unblock res.cloudinary.com and
      images.unsplash.com.
      These are the two services that deliver our images, so if they are being blocked then the images will not show
      up!

      I can't login/join a game/host a game?
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      These errors can occur for a few reasons. The main one is that a Chrome Extension such as an AdBlocker or other
      service is blocking part of the site's functionality. While we don't run ads, these can still interfere with
      some
      parts of the site. Second, if you still can't join or host a game, you may need to make sure firebaseio.com is
      unblocked on your device. We use this site for part of our backend, so if there is a firewall blocking it you
      may
      not be able to use parts of the site (however, this will not affect your ability to log in).

    <div class="text">
      Yes! All of our essential features are free! You can create an unlimited number of questions set and host a game
      with up to 60 people (300 people for Plus members (except Racing and team modes)). If you do want some extra
      features to enhance
      your Blooket experience (or just to support us), you can upgrade at

      How do I hide the notification asking students to create accounts?
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      After finishing a game, students are asked to create accounts (if they don't already have them) to track their
      stats
      and unlock new Blooks. Creating an account is totally optional, but some may not want their students to see
      this. If
      you would like to hide this notification, then before you host a game on the Host Settings page (after you
      select
      a game mode) uncheck the option that says “Allow Student Accounts” and it won’t show the notification.
